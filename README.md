Regression Models using Machine Learning. This repository contains a code template that allows you to implement various Regression models for different datasets using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging this template, you can easily experiment with and compare the performance of multiple Regression models by using various performance evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2-Score, empowering you to make informed decisions about which model to choose for your specific Regression task.

Installation: To use this code template locally, follow these steps: Clone the repository:

HTTP link -> git clone https://github.com/Greeshmanth19/Regression-Templet.git

Install the required dependencies:

command -> pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage: To implement Regression models using this code template, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or any other supported format). Open the regression_templet.py. Load your dataset into the notebook and preprocess the data as needed. After uploading the preprocessed dataset the code itself will run the dataset on all regression models, Train the model on your dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. Optionally, you can tweak hyperparameters, try different feature engineering techniques, or experiment with other preprocessing methods to improve model performance.

Supported Classification Models:

This code template provides implementations for the following classification models:

1. Multiple linear regression
2. Polynomial regression
3. Support vector regression
4. Decision tree regression
5. Random forest regression
6. XG Boost regression
Feel free to explore each model's implementation and customize them according to your requirements.
